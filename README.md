# Sign-Language-Translator

Sign Language Translator app for the American Sign Language (ASL) standards. This is the final year Bachelor's project. This project aims to convert hand sign language into meaningful letters in real time through camera feed to provide seamless communication. 
<br> Project contributors : 
 - **Satyaki Bhattacharjee** (ML/DL model making and creating the Prediction Pipeline)
 - **Krish Sharma** ( Integration of Model with the app internface ) 
 -  **Suyog Kasture** ( Web application designing)

Techstack used : Streamlit , Python ( Tensorflow ) , open-cv , Mediapipe

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset and we used custom dataset as well
<br> <br> in order to run the app, first run the following command on the terminal : ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` to install the necessary libraries. 
then run  ``` streamlit run App/app.py ``` on the terminal

## Here are some Insights of the app:
